# Ford Intern Coding Exercise
2021 Coding Exercise for Ford Credit Company Software Engineering Internship
## Description
I included two different exercises, although the prompt only asked for one. The mustangBronco GUI is the one I would like to submit for this test, but feel free to checkout the manhattan distance program as well. I've also included a file I used to run some tests on the mustangBronco algorithm. All of the programs use Python 3.9.0
## Instructions
# MustangBronco GUI
To run this program, you must have the tkinter package for python installed. However, I believe it should be installed with Python automatically
- run this program in a terminal using python
- a new window should appear with the GUI
- follow the instructions on the gui, a user input that can't be converted from string to int will not error out but instead print an error message and allow the user to try again
- close the new tk window or enter CTRL+C in the parent terminal to end the program 
# Manhattan Distance
- run this program in a terminal using python
- prompts should appear asking for the coordinates of the first and second points
- the points should be seperated by a space (specified in the prompt), i.e. input:<X1 Y2>
- if the user string is not able to be converted to int, the program will exit with an error
- after the distance is calculated and outputted, the program will end
